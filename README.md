# MAKING AN NFT COLLECTION
# Project Description 
My goal is to write code that will help me launch an NFT collection of 10,000 images. I will be designing all the art/layers for the project and hopefully releasing it once it's done.
# Software
I will be coding using Javascript to create the final images for the collection. I may or may not also need to learn some Solidity which is the language used to code smart contracts on the Ethereum network.
# Current Progress
I've now got most of the code done to generate the art, but am finishing up with the layers for making the nfts. Also, I will not be making 10,000 anymore as that was the original goal. I'm thinking now probably somewhere between 500 and 1000 will be perfect.
